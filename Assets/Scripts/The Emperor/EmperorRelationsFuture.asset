  Good: The Emperor, right side up. Power and authority. I see great abilities in
    you, and the people around you will see it too. They and your relationship with
    them will be strengthened.
  Bad: The Emperor, reversed. Strength and power are not always good. Be wary, as
    I see your actions will cause a rupture in your relationships and lose you any
    favor you have left over.
