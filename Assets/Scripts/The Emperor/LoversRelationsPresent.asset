  Good: The Devil, right side up. A card signifying deep-rooted fear. You are unable
    to show people your true self, as you are terrified of what would happen if you
    are not accepted.
  Bad: The Devil, reversed. A card of freedom. You are not as confined as you once
    thought. You have found an exit through the friends around you.
