  Good: The Devil, right side up. This signifies an unhealthy obsession. An early
    attachment of yours had grown too large, leaving you empty when you could no
    longer latch onto it.
  Bad: The Devil, reversed. This signifies braving something new. A moment of courage
    in your past allowed your bond with another to grow.
