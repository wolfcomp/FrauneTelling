  Good: The Emperor, right side up. A sign of stability. Now your current health
    is of no detriment to your life, though that may not be the case in the future.
  Bad: The Emperor, reversed. A sign of vulnerability. You lack a care that would
    save you from the harshness of illness if you simply tried.
