  Detailed: "He\u2019s pretty boring to follow. Tries to go around even though his
    bones be aching to all hell and should really just be stayin home. Not to say
    he\u2019s not easy on the eyes. Can\u2019t wait til he dies!  I found his journal
    though and boy was his life different before the army. A loving family, great
    relationships. I found an old football medal tucked away in his attic. The paper
    was a bit torn, but I think he got a football scholarship to boot! My kind of
    man!  But this guy\u2019s been through the wringer in the army. Can\u2019t sleep
    a wink no more. I\u2019ve seen him try to brew his own herbal medicine instead
    of visiting a doctor. I think I know why. I\u2019ve watched him long enough to
    notice that he looks weary at others. Not because he\u2019s afraid of them, but
    because he\u2019s worried they\u2019ll be afraid of him. That refusal to get
    close is gonna be the end of him. Then I\u2019ll have the chance to get close
    to him! "
