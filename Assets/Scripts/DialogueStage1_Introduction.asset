  Dialogue:
  - Hiya sweetie!
  - 'I got you some tidbits of your clients, wrote it down on that file of yours,
    dear.  '
  - 'Just let me know what more information I should note down for you. *wink* '
  - OO! Do I have some extra juicy details for you.
  - "Did you know that\u2013 "
  - "Oh, I\u2019ll just let you read it yourself. Let me know what cards you need
    me to put in for you. "
  - Now go do what you do best, sweetheart!
