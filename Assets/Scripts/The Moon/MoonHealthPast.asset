  Good: The Moon, right side up. This card tells me you followed your gut. Your quick
    thinking has helped you avoid many injuries, but it has not always left you without
    a scratch.
  Bad: The Moon, reversed. It tells you to use your head. With your ability to ask
    for help from others, you have managed to keep going, even when you were hurting.
