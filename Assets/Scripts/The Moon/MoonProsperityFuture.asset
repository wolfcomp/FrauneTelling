  Good: The Moon, right side up. A card of intuition. You will be given a new opportunity,
    greater than any other. You will find it if you use your gut.
  Bad: The Moon, reversed. Using your reason will be key. A conflict will arise,
    proving to be a threat to your way of life. Do not let emotions cloud your judgement.
