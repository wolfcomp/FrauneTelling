  Good: The Moon, right side up. The card of secrets. You have a way of driving yourself
    that is unique to you. It is a secret no one else but you knows.
  Bad: The Moon, reversed. The card represents openness. You have no problems showing
    your hand, believing that you cannot lose in life, or perhaps there is nothing
    left to lose?
