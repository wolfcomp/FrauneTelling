  Good: The Moon, right side up. This card represents intuition. In the past you
    followed your gut and it gave you a headstart in life. But was it really the
    best path you could have taken?
  Bad: The Moon, reversed. A symbol of reason. Your logical mind created many opportunities,
    allowing you many advantages economically. Did you end up using them?
