  Good: "The Moon, reversed. It reveals itself to those who don\u2019t tend to keep
    secrets. By opening up and sharing your knowledge with others you now have many
    friends."
  Bad: "The Moon, right side up. This tells me you\u2019ve been keeping quiet in
    your relationships. Your secrets are heavy on your shoulders and a burden on
    your bonds."
