  Good: "The Moon, right side up. The card of hidden truths. You assume revealing
    it will end your relationships, but what will happen if you don\u2019t will be
    much worse."
  Bad: The Moon, reversed. It urges people to be open but also to use their mind.
    You will try to force others to be as open as you are, tearing a large rift between
    those you care about.
