  Good: "The Moon, reversed. Your future is shrouded in secrets. You will have an
    encounter that will defy your reason. It will leave you broken if you don\u2019t
    bring it to light."
  Bad: The Moon, right side up. You often figure out your cause of harm without help,
    but your inability to share it with others will hurt you greatly when they are
    the only ones who can save you.
