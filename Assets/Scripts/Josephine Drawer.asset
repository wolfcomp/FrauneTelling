  Name: Josephine Joanna Jessica Jerv
  Occupation: CEO of Jerv Enterprises
  Detailed: "She had a meeting at 11:15. Afterwards heard her talking shit about
    her old boss to a friend of hers. Apparently, she used to rake in some good money
    for that business. They\u2019ve been trying to get her back for years. Said those
    vipers tried to suck her dry last time and there ain\u2019t no way she\u2019s
    going back!  Round 12:33 she walked by a group of employees. Funny thing is I
    heard one of her coworkers whisper about her tossing some underlings to the curb
    after they finished some workload. Looks like she\u2019s quite the hypocrite.
    Listened around that conversation for a bit. She\u2019s not popular.  13:18 Jessica
    went out with her sister for some lunch. The woman wouldn\u2019t stop gushing
    about her anniversary plans with her husband and a party with her friends. If
    I didn\u2019t have such a keen eye for people, i\u2019d think Jessica was bored.
    I swear she looked jealous, maybe even longing.  "
