  Detailed: "He\u2019s already such a shy man, it\u2019s easy to tell he never got
    much lovin in his early life. Listened in on a phone call he had at 9:13 during
    his job. Apologized over and over again to his client before leavin to take the
    call. Turns out it was his mother! I think she barely qualifies as a mother with
    the amount of disinterest she had in her own kid. I\u2019ll spit on her grave
    and give her a punch when she dies.  His coworker gave him a good pat on the
    shoulder, told him she\u2019d take care of the client since it looked like he
    needed a moment. He\u2019s definitely got some friends now, but I don\u2019t
    think anyone knows his past. Big fella probably doesn\u2019t want to burden them
    with it.  He really ought to reach out to them. Get the real lovin he deserves.
    Lord knows the past haunts ya real fierce if ya can\u2019t air it out to someone
    else. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s got much deeper things happening in his life.  "
