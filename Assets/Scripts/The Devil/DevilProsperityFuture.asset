  Good: The Devil, right side up. Something will take hold of you, chaining you to
    the point of manic obsession. Its pursuit will lead you to ruin.
  Bad: The Devil, reversed. This is the card of liberation. Take control and fight
    for what is right and people will follow. Continue to do this and your future
    will be filled with prosperity.
