  Good: The Devil, right side up. The card of shackles and fear. You are scared by
    other's opinions of you. Your dwelling on other's thoughts is making it harder
    for you to relax.
  Bad: "The Devil, reversed. You\u2019ve broken your shackles. You are no longer
    slowed down by your previous shackles and currently find life's hardships easier
    to handle."
