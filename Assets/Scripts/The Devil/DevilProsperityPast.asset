  Good: The Devil, right side up. This card relates to fear and control. In your
    past, your fear drove you on a path away from what you dreamt of as a child.
  Bad: The Devil, reversed. Rather than being controlled, you were the one with the
    reins. You achieved recognition when you stood up for your ideals.
